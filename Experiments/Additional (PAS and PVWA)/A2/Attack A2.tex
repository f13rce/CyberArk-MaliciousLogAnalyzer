Windows:
Login without PVWA/PSM with Mike (domain admin) on DC01

Login possible and no alerts/logs generated by Vault :O
Conclusion: no actions logged from client, except for interactions on PVWA web page.

Possible "workaround": Only make accounts in PVWA domain admin/give RDS access.

Linux: Not possible
