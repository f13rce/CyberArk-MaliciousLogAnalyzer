Goal: Capture system information by creating a script that is run as root

Windows:
Mike -> Root -> test.bat

```
systeminfo
systeminfo /s 10.0.0.15 /u hackerman /p welcome01

ipconfig /all
```



Linux:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

sudo su
lsb_release -a
df -h /dev/sda1
ip addr show
uptime
free
cat /etc/passwd
cat /etc/shadow
cat ~/bash_history
history
lshw
lspci
```

Ivar -> Root -> nano test.sh -> chmod +x test.sh -> ./test.sh
